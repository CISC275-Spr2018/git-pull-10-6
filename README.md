# Team 6 // Lab 8
<b>Adam Caulfield, Al Cooper, Muhammet Aydin, Ryan Melillo, Will Walker</b>

Muhammet: Incorporated timer to animate instead of the for loop that was being used before. Implemented arrow key functionality to move orc N, W, S, and E. 

Will: Implemented jumping + fire logic upon keyboard input and the changing of sprites assosciated with jumping. Refactored code to use enumerators where possible.

Adam: Updated View to incorporate jumping, and switching between Jumping and Walking with the signal from the controller.

Ryan: updated view to fix the problem where starting/stopping the game would take focus away from the keyboard, stopping
any keyboard input from doing anything

Al: Collaborated to implement moving with keyboard controls and button listener logic.
